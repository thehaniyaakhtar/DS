# underfitting and overfitting
'''
Testing different values of max_leaf_nodes for Decision Tree and calculating MAE for each
1. Train DTR with given max_leaf_nodes
2. Making predictions on validation sets
3. Calculates and prints MAE to evaluate performances

low max_leaf_nodes = 5, high MAE, underfitting
high max_leaf_nodes = 5000, overfit 
optimal max_leaf_nodes: minimize MAE without overfitting
