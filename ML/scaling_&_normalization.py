# scaling and normalization
#  scaling: changing the range of features values
# data distribution shape/ relationship does not change
# chnges the magnitude
# eg: [0, 10000] to [0, 1]
# important for distance based algos, SVM, KNN
# as larger features may end up dominating model

# min max scaling
# rescales data to a fixed range usually [0, 1]
# preserves the original distribution shape
# min value: 0, max value: 1
# sensitive to outliers
# relative distances between points remain same
# sensitive to outliers
