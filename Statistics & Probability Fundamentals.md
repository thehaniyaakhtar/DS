## Descriptive vs. Inferential statistics
- Descriptive Stats: summarizing and describing data
- Does not try to generalize/predict
- Only answers how the dataset looks like

1. Measures of Central Tendency:
   - Mean: Average
   - Median: Middle Value
   - Mode: Most frequent value
     
2. Measures of Spread:
   - Range: Max - Min
   - Variance: Average: Average Squared deviation
   - Standard Deviation: Typical distance from mean
   - IQR: Middle 50% spread

3. Distribution Shape:
   - Skewness (left or right tail)
   - Kurtosis (weight of tail)

- Inferential Statistics: Using a small sample to make conclusions about a larger population
- Entire population cannot be measured, a sample is analyzed and the population is infered

1. Estimation:
   - Estimating poplulation parameters from a sample.

2. Hypothesis Testing
   - Make a claim (Null Hypothesis)
   - Collect sample data
   - Calculate probability (p-value)
   - Accept/Reject claim

3. Regression
   - Poplulation slope is estimated
   - Significance of features
   - Confidence intervals of coefficients
